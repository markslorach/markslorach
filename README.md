## 👋 Hello, I'm Mark.

I'm a Junior Software Developer with a keen interest in full-stack development. I recently graduated from CodeClan's software development bootcamp following a career as a freelance videographer. I enjoy all things code, especially working with React and the JavaScript ecosystem.

  - Improving the design and adding features to [minilist](https://github.com/markslorach/minilist.git).
  - Researching MDX and headless CMS systems to incorporate a blog into my [personal website](https://markslorach.com).

🌱 I’m currently learning -
  - React Query and Redux state management.
