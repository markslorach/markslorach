## 👋 Hello, I'm Mark.

I'm a full-stack developer with a keen interest in front-end development. I recently graduated from CodeClan's software development bootcamp following a career as a freelance videographer. I enjoy all things code, especially working with React and the JavaScript ecosystem.

👨‍💻 I’m currently working on -
  - Improving the design and adding more features to [minilist](https://github.com/markslorach/minilist.git).

🌱 I’m currently learning -
  - React Query and Redux state management.
  - TypeScript for improved code quality and maintainability.
