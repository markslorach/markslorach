# Hi there, I’m Mark 👋
!Header image
I’m a design and user experience focused software developer based in Scotland. I’m passionate about creating user-friendly, innovative, and dynamic applications.
# About me
* 🎓 I’m a recent graduate from a 16-week software development bootcamp at CodeClan, where I learned Python, JavaScript, and Java, as well as working with frameworks, databases, and test-driven development.
* 💻 I’m currently working with and learning about Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Content Management Systems.
* 🎥 Before my career change, I worked as a freelance videographer and drone operator for six years, delivering creative content for brands and businesses all around Europe.
* 🌎 In my spare time, you’ll usually find me travelling around the incredible parts of Scotland with my drone and camera. I’ll never get tired of visiting Glencoe!
* 🚀 I’m looking for my first role in the tech industry where I can bring my enthusiasm and creativity and continue to learn and grow as a developer.
